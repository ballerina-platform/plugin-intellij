## Diagram View

The underlying language semantics of Ballerina were designed by modeling how independent parties communicate via structured interactions. 
Subsequently, every Ballerina program can be displayed as a sequence diagram of its flow with endpoints including synchronous and asynchronous calls.
To view the sequence diagram of a ballerina file, click the diagram icon  
( ![design view icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-lang/2fd0bdd4e7d081adf23901ed65eca32623d81889/tool-plugins/vscode/docs/show-diagram-icon.png) ) 
in the top right corner of the IDE window.

## Auto Import Unambiguous Modules

When you copy and paste some Ballerina code, this feature automatically imports unambiguous imports. Then you can manually import any modules with ambiguity by clicking on the module name and pressing `Alt + Enter` keys.

**Note:** Please note that this feature is disabled by default since this might cause issues if the file contains 
grammar mistakes. 
You can enable it by selecting the **Add unambiguous imports on the fly** CheckBox in **Settings -> Languages and Frameworks -> Ballerina -> Auto Imports**.
